in the 'doc' directory.

## Building and Installation

In most environments a simple 'make' will compile the program.
 
SunOS/Solaris:
In order to compile under Solaris the 'src/Makefile' needs to be edited.
See the Makefile for instructions.

Windows:
A Makefile.win is included for building for using with Nmake, i.e.
'nmake -f Makefile.win'.
 
For further installation simply copy the resulting binary and man page
(in the 'doc' directory) to appropriate system directories.
